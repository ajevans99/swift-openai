# Swift OpenAI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in active development and does not support many endpoints yet.
> Public API is likely to have major breaking changes.

[![CI](https://github.com/ajevans99/swift-openai/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ajevans99/swift-openai/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

A modern Swift package for interacting with [OpenAI’s API]((https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)), built on top of the official OpenAI *OpenAPI* spec.

## Library Structure

| Layer | Package | Description | Use Case |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| 🚀 1 — High-level API | **`OpenAIKit`** | Opinionated wrapper for conversational agents using tools, including the `Tool` protocol, `ResponseSession` actor, error policies, and streaming support. | Build assistants, chatbots, and AI-powered features with minimal setup. |
| 🧠 2 — Swifty OpenAI Client | **`OpenAICore`** | Lightweight async wrapper around the OpenAI API with ergonomic Swift types and methods like `createResponse(...)`. Built on top of `OpenAICore`. | Interact directly with OpenAI endpoints in a clean, modern Swift style. |
| 🛠️ 3 — Low-level Generated Layer | **`OpenAIFoundation`** | Fully autogenerated models and API client from the OpenAPI spec. No opinions, no wrappers—just raw access. | Advanced integrations, custom wrappers, or OpenAPI-driven workflows. |


> 💡 All layers rely on a pluggable transport layer conforming to [`ClientTransport` protocol](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/main/documentation/openapiruntime/clienttransport). You can use [`OpenAPIAsyncHTTPClient`](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-openapi-async-http-client), [`OpenAPIURLSession`](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-urlsession), or bring your own.

## **`OpenAIKit`**

1. Define your tools, conforming to the `Tool` protocol.

2. Register your tools

3. Setup a `ResponseSession`

4. Start streaming (or send async request)


## **`OpenAICore`**

## **`OpenAIFoundation`**

| Endpoint | Supported? |
| --- | --- |
| `/responses` | [x] |
| `/images` | [x] |

## Code Genertion

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only relevant for library maintainers. If you're just using the package, you can skip this.

> Patches are messed up currently!

`swift-openai` uses `swift-openapi-generator` to generate models and endpoint definitions directly from OpenAI’s official [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi). This ensures maximum compatibility and future-proofing as the spec evolves.

To ensure the generated code compiles and behaves correctly in Swift, we apply a series of patch files located in the `Patches/` directory to the `swift-openapi.yaml` spec. These are applied before generation via a custom script. This workaround is necessary because the raw OpenAPI spec includes some constructs that are either unsupported or problematic for the Swift OpenAPI toolchain.

| Task                                    | Command          |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------|
| To check for spec changes               | `make check`     |
| To fetch the latest `openapi.yaml`      | `make fetch`     |
| To apply the necessary patches          | `make patches`   |
| To generate the Swift types             | `make generate`  |
| To fetch, patch, and generate           | `make all`       |

To generate patches, make changes to the yaml and run:

```sh
git diff Sources/OpenAIFoundation/openapi.yaml > Patches/<two-digit-sort-number-here>-<patch-description-here>.patch
```
